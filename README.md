# Tetris

This is one of my first project that I've started when learning how to code. 

Functions:
- Creating a window
- Creating the block shapes
- Rotating the blocks
- Clearing the lane when it's full
- Adding Sounds and Music

Overall, the projects turned out well. I still wish to improve this current project with a different window or add in my own design and sounds.
